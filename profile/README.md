# DevIsko-Hackathon

Welcome to the DevIsko-Hackathon organization on GitHub! We are a group of scholar students from Polytechnic University of the Philippines who are interested in learning and applying new technologies through hackathons and coding challenges.

## About Us

We believe that hackathons and coding challenges are a great way to improve our skills in programming, teamwork, and problem-solving. Our goal is to participate in as many hackathons as possible, collaborate with other developers, and create innovative solutions to real-world problems.

## Projects

Our organization is currently working on various projects, including web and mobile applications, data analysis tools, and machine learning models. We use GitHub to collaborate on these projects, share code, and review each other's work.

## Get Involved

If you are a student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines and interested in joining our organization, feel free to reach out to us on GitHub or through our official email. We welcome students from all backgrounds and skill levels.
